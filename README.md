# A-B-test
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.
For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# installtion
You should to be able to work in a Jupyter Notebook and install these libraries:

* Numpy

* Pandas

* Matplotlib

* Statsmodels

* Scipy

# part of projects 
Part I - Probability

Part II - A/B Test

Part III - Regression

# Result 
p-value, probability of obtaining results that are close to the real results observed in the experiment.


p-value is 0.1899 and is greater than 0.05.


the country doesn't have impact on convention rate


P-value for UK is higher than CA so people in UK they may convert more

From the analysis there is no sufficient evidence that the new page leads to more conversions than the old page.
